1. Description

The project consists on create an entire experience to a new way of a company or a group of people manage their appointments and meetings. taking advantage of all the most advanced and more stable technologies, we try to make the best experience to schedule meetings, easy and effective.


2. Technology

We choose to use Rails in back-end for two simple questions, first, the language and the framework are hands down, easy and most effective to development, and secondly, we need an technology that allows us to create an entire application modularized, and Rails can do that for sure. In a client-side view, we try to use hardcore Jquery with module pattern, which maintain the security and stability. For a better and to make the user experience flows, we choose Ajax for database interactions and to have fun!


3. Structure
